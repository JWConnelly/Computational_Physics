Copy and paste from the LON-CAPA he opened up earlier today.

100 possible points. For the mid term you will write a simulation code for the project your group selected.

    Clearly explain the physical problem your are trying to address

    Explain what is required to solve the problem you address. How did you divide up the work among your group?

    Write the code necessary to address the problem you want to solve. What unexpected difficulties did you encounter? How did you address them?

    Analyse the data your code is generating. Do the results agree with your hypothesis? How are the results different from your expectations? What does that tell you about your project?

    Write a LaTeX document that explains the algorithm you have developed and the results you obtained with the algorithm.

    Upload your code.

While I encourage you all to work together, everyone is supposed to submit a write-up. Of course you can exchange results, but in your writeup I would like you to have a section that focuses on your own contribution to the project.

Have fun.
